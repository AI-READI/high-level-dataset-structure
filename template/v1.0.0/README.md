## Overview of the study
The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine a light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health. Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions are working together to develop this flagship dataset. The project will aim to collect data from 4,000 participants across three sites: the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), the University of California San Diego (UCSD), and the University of Washington (UW). To ensure the data is population-representative, the 4,000 participants will be balanced for three factors: disease severity, ethnicity, and sex. aireadi.org

## Description of the dataset
This dataset contain data from 20 participants from the pilot study of the project. Details about the participants of the study are provided in the [participants.json](participants.json) metadata file. Data from multiple modalities are collected. A full list is provided in the "Data Standards" section below. The data in this dataset has been deidentified using awesome tools x, y, z and contain no personel health information (PHI).  

The dataset contains a total of 1,265 files (including data and metadata files) and is 420 GB in size.

## Data standards followed
This dataset is organized at the highest-level following [Clinical Dataset Structure](https://github.com/AI-READI/high-level-dataset-structure). Each data type was organized according to an existing standard available for that data type or a newly introduced one if no community agreed standard was found. Details are provided int table below.

| Data type      | Standards followed |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Electrocardiogram      | [X standard]()       |
| Optical Coherence Tomography   | [Y standard]()      |
