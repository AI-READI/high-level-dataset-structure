## Overview
The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine a light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health. Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions will work together to develop this flagship dataset.

## Description
In this study, 1000 participants have been participated.

## Dataset access/restrictions
This dataset is publicly accessible.

## Data standards
The goal of the Standards is to establish a set of formatting requirements for the different types of data that will be collected for the AI-READI dataset. The Standards Module works to streamline the development of AI models for researchers who access the AI-READI dataset. Standardized data will facilitate data sharing as well as evaluation and reproducibility of study results.

## Resources
Leveraging a partnership with Microsoft, fairhub.io will be developed using Azure Cloud Services. The platform will include convenient tools to track clinical and biomedical data collection, prepare and share FAIR data, and conveniently access data for future AI/ML analysis.
In addition, the Tools module will support the effort of the Data Acquisition module by setting up and managing additional tools such REDCap.
