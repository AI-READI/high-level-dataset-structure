# Compliance of the BCDS with relevant FAIR principles

## About
The [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) published in 2016 are the outcome of a large scale international effort for increasing the reuse of research data. 
They provide 15 high-level instructions for optimizing the reuse of research data by humans and machines. They are widely adopted by all fields of research, including biomedical research. 
We explain here how implementing the BCDS enables to comply with the FAIR principles related to dataset structure and metadata files. 

## Compliance assessment 

### F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below) 

### F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe. 

### I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. 

### I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles 

### I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data 

### R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes 

### R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license 

### R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance 

### R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
