# LICENSE.txt

## About
The LICENSE.txt is a metadata file that contains the terms under which the dataset is shared. This file is intended to provide a human readable overview of 
requirements and conditions for reusing the data. It is inspired by the LICENSE metadata file from the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/).

## Specifications

### Requirement
This metadata is mandatory for all datasets.

### Name
This metadata file must be named `LICENSE`.

### Format
This metadata file must be in the text format. The full name with extension must thus be `LICENSE.txt`.

### Location
This metadata file must be located at the highest-level/root-level of the dataset.

### Content
If possible, a standard license from the [Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) should be used. 
When using a standard license listed in the SPDX license list, the content of this file must be exactly as the text listed in the "Text" section 
of that license on the corresponding SPDX page. If another license outside of those listed in the SPDX license list is used, a link to 
documentation about the license must be included if available.
